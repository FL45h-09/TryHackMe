#Day-7
....................................................................
====================================================================
It's 6 AM and Elf McSkidy is clocking-in to The Best Festival Company's SOC headquarters to begin his watch over TBFC's infrastructure. After logging in, Elf McEager proceeds to read through emails left by Elf McSkidy during the nightshift.

More automatic scanning alerts, oh look, another APT group. It feels like it's going to be a long, but easy start to the week for Elf McEager.

Whilst clearing the backlog of emails, Elf McEager reads the following: "URGENT: Data exfiltration detected on TBFC-WEB-01". "Uh oh" goes Elf McEager. "TBFC-WEB-01? That's Santa's webserver! Who has the motive to steal data from there?!". It's time for the ever-vigilant Elf McEager to prove his salt and find out exactly what happened.

Unknowingly to Elf McEager, Elf McSkidy made this all up! Fortunately, this isn't a real attack - but a training exercise created ahead of Elf McEager's performance review.
