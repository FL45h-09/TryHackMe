#Day-3
===================================================================

McSkidy is walking down the corridor and hears a faint bleeping noise, Beep.... Beep.... Beep... as McSkidy gets closer to Sleigh Engineering Room the faint noise gets louder and louder.. BEEP.... BEEP.... Something is clearly wrong! McSkidy runs to the room, slamming open the door to see Santa's sleighs control panel lite up in red error messages! "Santa sleigh! It's been hacked, code red.. code red!" he screams as he runs back to the elf security command center.

Can you help McSkidy and his team hack into Santa's Sleigh to re-gain control?
