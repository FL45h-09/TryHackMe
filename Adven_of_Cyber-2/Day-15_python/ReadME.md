#Day 15: Python

Have you ever wondered how the elves manage to keep up with building toys for so many people all around the world? Do you ever get sad and think "huh, with 7 billion people in the world and growing that means that each elf will be working non-stop to build toys! They'll never get a break!"

Well, I have good news for you. Thanks to the magic of Santa, elves have machines that can build toys for them. This machine requires an elf to design a toy, and then describe how to make the toy in a scripting language.

Scripting languages are special types of programming languages well suited for smaller, shorter programs such as the designs of a toy.

This document is for any elves looking to work with Santa. Once you have completed this you'll be able to easily manufacture toys and use Santa's APIs!
