Day 9: Anyone can be Santa - Prelude:

ï»¿Even Santa has been having to adopt the "work from home" ethic in 2020. To help Santa out, Elf McSkidy and their team created a file server for The Best Festival Company (TBFC) that uses the FTP protocol. However, an attacker was able to hack this new server. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to understand how this hack occurred and to retrace the steps of the attacker.
